            <h2> A life long passion</h2>
            <p>Real estate has always been a part of my life. My dad started his company when I was just 8 years old. He often took me to his office and on visits to the properties he managed. I was fascinated by the design and architecture of each property, but at the time, I didn’t fully appreciate what I was learning.</p>
            <p>As I approached the end of high school, my dad encouraged me to join the family business to gain experience. At first, I wasn’t interested for two main reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I was embarrassed to work—none of my friends had jobs at that age.</li>
                <li>I felt unprepared and lacked confidence in what I was supposed to do.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Despite my initial hesitation, my dad convinced me to give it a try. Looking back, I’m so glad he did. My journey in real estate has been transformative, teaching me invaluable lessons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resilience: Success often requires persistence and adaptability.</li>
                <li>Professionalism: Conducting yourself with integrity matters in every situation.</li>
                <li>Goal Setting: Clear objectives are essential for personal and business growth.</li>
                <li>Networking: Building relationships can open doors you never imagined possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I’m deeply grateful to my dad and the real estate industry for shaping who I am today. These experiences have not only helped me grow but also connected me with incredible people and opportunities that will continue to impact my future.</p>
            <h3>My advice to YOU!</h3>
            <p>Listen to the wisdom of those with more experience—it can change your life for the better. Real estate has taught me that the right guidance can make all the difference.</p>
